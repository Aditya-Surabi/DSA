Queue are built into Java but as an interface. This means you can't explicitly instantiate a queue
like this : Queue a = new Queue();   X

 You must instantiate an implementation of it. example linkedlist
 like this: Queue a = new LinkedList();

Queue operate on the principle of first in first out. A line up is a good representation
of how a queue operates. First person in lines gets to go first. Last person in line goes last.

Wrapper Implementation

public class SimpleQueue implements Queue{

  private LinkedList<Object> data = new LinkedList<Object>();
  public void enqueue(Object item) {data.addLast(item);}
  public Object dequeue() {return data.removeFirst();}
  public Object peek() {return data.getFirst();}
  public int size() {return data.size();}
  public boolean isEmpty() {return data.isEmpty();}

}
